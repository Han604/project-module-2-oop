Hi, I want to use this space to talk about the changes that I have made, and the changes that I will make to improve this game and make it into something a lot more fun.

Changes:
    since this game increases the amount of areas for enemies to spawn in, I decided to make the play space larger so you can have more visibility and a wider space to move around in for more technical game play.
    I have fixed the issue where the character does not die

What I want to make the game do:
    - the current way that the game moves is too rigid and doesn't allow for tight movement in gameplay, I'm going to lower the amount that the object gets styled to be more precise.
    - I want to introduce enemy patterns to the game using the script that pushes enemies into an area making the gameplay a little less random
    - introduce varied enemy movement so that the game feels more like a challenge instead of a randomly generated experience
    - introduce a shooting system that allows for the player on spacebar to fire a gun that has a cooldown
    - introduce a power up system that generates a tiny cheeseburger to the left, and then to the right of the burger that will fire when you fire, but will be destroyed if a cat touches it.
